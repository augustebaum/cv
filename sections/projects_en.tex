\cventry{2022---2023}{MSc project: ``Path regularization for continuous counterfactual explanations''}{Swisscom \& EPFL}{Lausanne}{}{
  Developed a novel generative model regularization technique to produce high-quality explanations of deep neural network predictions.
  Supervised by \href{https://www.epfl.ch/labs/lts4/people/people-current/frossard/}{Prof.~Pascal Frossard} and \href{https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Daniel-Dobos-2}{Dr Daniel Dobos}.

\cventry{2021}{Machine learning project: \href{https://github.com/CS-433/cs-433-project-2-vortexnco}{``Automatic detection of available area for rooftop solar panel installations''}}{EPFL}{Lausanne}{}{
  Built a neural network model to detect the empty space on rooftops in satellite images.
  % Supervisor: Dr Roberto Castello.
  % To weigh the costs of deploying solar panel infrastructure, we use \href{https://pytorch.org}{PyTorch} to train a convolutional neural network on \textit{unprocessed} satellite images
  % to detect the empty space on rooftops, and reach an $F_1$-score of 0.77.
}

\cventry{2020}{BSc project: ``Machine Learning methods for Property Prediction''}{UCL}{London}{}{
  Reviewed recent approaches to chemical property prediction with machine learning.
  % Supervisor: \href{https://www.zwijnenburg-group.org/research/}{Dr Martijn Zwijnenburg}.
  % Predicting the properties of molecules has myriad applications,
  % from medical drugs to solar cells, but current methods are limited.
  % We review recent attempts to boost property prediction
  % by machine learning.
